-- plan is to make a virtual table of First_visit_date. 
-- So that we can join the Customer_order Table and First_visit_table data
-- Then If order_date = fv_date Then --> New Cx ELSE Repeat Cx


-- Making a virtula table using CTE, using a "with" clause
-- first_visit = virtual table which we can join to main table
with first_visit as (
SELECT customer_id,min(order_date) as first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders
group by customer_id) -- This CTE shows which Cx has what first_visit_date

-- now we are gonna create another CTE
-- we can basicaly have multiple CTE or Virtual Tables created
-- here "visit_flag" is the second CTE

, visit_flag as (
SELECT co.*,fv.first_visit_date 
-- Now we are making new columns by creating a calc field
, CASE WHEN co.order_date=fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as New_flag
, CASE WHEN co.order_date!=fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as Repeat_flag

FROM customer_orders as co
inner join first_visit fv on co.customer_id = fv.customer_id) 
-- This CTE is a combination of the CTE1 and Customer_order table shows new_flag and repeat flag

-- Now in the above code we have 2 CTE or virtual tables created.
-- Now we need to aggregate the CTE in the follwoing format :-
-- Order_date , new_cx , Repeat_cx
-- for this format we need to aggregate the above two CTE by order_date

SELECT order_date, SUM(New_flag) as New_Cx, SUM(Repeat_flag) as Repeat_Cx
FROM visit_flag
GROUP BY order_date
